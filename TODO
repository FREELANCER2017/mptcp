Morteza: the reason is mptcp subflows would be created in middle of run time, so no way to can hook them in configuration time. This partially being solved in MpTcpSubflow by calling to StartTracing() and then CwndTracer().I can recall there was bug in m_socket which prevent socket to fire call back at all :-)
